# Matchstick-14-28-March-

The goal of this project, based on a famous Matchstick game, is to create a program that you can play against.

Every turn, each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The one to remove the last matchstick loses.


To launch the program, use "./matchstick l m"

l = number of lines

m = maximum number of matches that can be taken out each turn
