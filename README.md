# Matchstick-14-28-March-

The goal of this project, based on a famous Matchstick game, is to create a program that you can play against.

Every turn, each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The one to remove the last matchstick loses.

To compile the code, use the command "make" at the project's root.

Then to launch the program: "./matchstick l m"

l = number of lines

m = maximum number of matches that can be taken out each turn
